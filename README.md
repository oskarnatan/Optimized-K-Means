# Optimized-K-Means

In this repository, I do a research about dataset clustering. I use K-Means algorithm to cluster a dataset called ruspini. In order to enhance performance of this algorithm, an optimization method is used to optimize K-means. In this research, I use python programming (python 3.6) on anaconda spyder. The result shows how the data is being clustered using matplotlib library and also shows the value of cluster variance.
