# Optimized-K-Means

In this repository, I saved my college project about dataset clustering. I use K-Means algorithm to cluster a dataset called ruspini. In order to enhance performance of this algorithm, an optimization method is used to optimize K-means. I use python programming (python 3.6) on anaconda spyder. Meanwhile, the dataset is saved in csv format (ruspini.csv). The result shows how the data is being clustered using matplotlib library and also shows the value of cluster variance.
